              Yogurt (UK: /ˈjɒɡərt/; US: /ˈjoʊɡərt/,[1] from Turkish: yoğurt)
              also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by
              bacterial fermentation of milk.[2] The bacteria used to make
              yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. Fermentation of sugars in the
              milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk
              protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart
              flavor.[2] Cow's milk is the milk most commonly used to make
              yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, yaks
              and plant milks are also used to produce yogurt. The milk used may
              be homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of
              milk produces substantially different results.
